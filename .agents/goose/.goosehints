# Dotfiles repository

Personal dotfiles managed with Bazel for cross-platform configuration management.

## Documentation

See `.agents/AGENTS.md` for complete project context, commands, and guidelines.

## Quick commands

```bash
# Build personal profile
bazel build //... --//config:profile=personal

# Test and install
bazel test //...
bazel run //config:install_all
```

## Key principles

- All configurations in `src/{tool}/` packages
- Guarded installation prevents overwriting user configs
- Personal/work profiles with different settings
- Installation targets tagged `manual`
- Security paramount with pinned versions

## Before making changes

1. Read `.agents/AGENTS.md` for full context
2. Query dependencies: `bazel query "deps(//target)" --output label`
3. Inspect build outputs: Run `bazel build` and examine files
4. Find patterns: `grep -r` for similar implementations
5. Read all relevant files before suggesting changes

Refer to `.agents/AGENTS.md` for comprehensive documentation.
