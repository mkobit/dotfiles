## Usage

Create files with the format `yyyy-MM-dd-project-name.md` for:
- Concise task lists
- Project decisions and rationale
- Session notes and progress tracking
- Temporary documentation that needs persistence across sessions

## Examples

- `2025-09-06-security-audit.md` - Security review checklist and findings

## Guidelines

- Keep files focused and concise
- Include dates in filenames for easy sorting
- Use markdown format for readability
- Archive or delete files when projects are complete
- This directory is git-ignored except for this README
