This directory contains the Starlark rules and macros that power the dotfiles management system.

== Overview

The modules directory contains `.bzl` files that define reusable Starlark rules and macros 
designed specifically for managing dotfiles. This approach promotes modularity by 
encapsulating rule logic and prevents redundancy across the repository.

== Available Modules

* `rules/dotfile.bzl`: Core rules for managing dotfiles
* `rules/symlink.bzl`: Rules for creating symbolic links
* `rules/template.bzl`: Rules for processing template files

== Usage

To use these rules in your BUILD files, import them as follows:

[source,python]
----
load("//modules/rules:dotfile.bzl", "dotfile")
load("//modules/rules:symlink.bzl", "symlink")
load("//modules/rules:template.bzl", "template_file")
----
