= Tmux Configuration Module

This module provides a modular tmux configuration system that is:

* Split into logical components
* Version-aware to handle feature differences
* Platform-aware for OS-specific settings

== Components

The tmux configuration is split into these components:

* Core settings: Basic tmux server and session options
* Display settings: Terminal, status line, and visual appearance
* Keybindings: Key mappings for navigation and control
* Mouse settings: Mouse behavior configuration
* Copy mode settings: Settings for copy/paste operations
* Platform-specific settings: OS-dependent configurations

== Usage

To use the tmux configuration, include it in your build:

[source,python]
----
load("@rules_dotfiles//dotfiles:defs.bzl", "dotfiles_package")

dotfiles_package(
    name = "my_dotfiles",
    deps = [
        "//modules/tmux:tmux",  # Standard version
        # OR
        "//modules/tmux:work_tmux",  # Work variant
        # OR
        "//modules/tmux:personal_tmux",  # Personal variant
    ],
)
----

== Customization

=== Local Overrides

Add custom settings in `~/.tmux.conf.local` which is automatically sourced if present.

=== Variants

Three variants are provided:
* Default: Standard configuration
* Work: Settings for work environments
* Personal: Settings for personal machines

== Toolchain Detection

This module automatically detects the installed tmux version and enables features based on availability:

* Enhanced window rearrangement for tmux 3.0+
* Popup windows for tmux 3.2+
* Extended key handling for tmux 3.2+

== Extension Points

=== Additional Modules

To add your own module:

1. Create a template file in `tools/tmux/modules/`
2. Add it to the BUILD file in `tools/tmux`
3. Include it in the main config

=== Platform Detection

Platform-specific settings are handled automatically through:

* OS detection for clipboard integration
* Terminal capability detection
* Version detection for feature availability
