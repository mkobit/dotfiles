# Technical writing guidelines

Follow these rules when writing standalone documentation.

## Ventilated prose
Write one sentence per line.
Break lines at every period that ends a sentence.
This improves diff readability.
This makes sentence length obvious.

## Sentence case titles
Use sentence case for all headers.
Capitalize only the first word and proper nouns.

## Concise writing
Be terse.
Omit needless words.
Use active voice.
Focus on self-documenting structure.

## Output format
Do not wrap paragraphs.
Output text strictly following these rules.
