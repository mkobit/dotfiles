# chezmoi data file - defines template variables available in templates
# See: https://www.chezmoi.io/reference/special-files/chezmoidata-format/
#
# This file is intentionally left empty. Tool configurations have been
# refactored into individual files within the .chezmoidata/ directory.
#
# To add a new tool configuration, create a new file in that directory,
# for example: .chezmoidata/new_tool.toml
#
# This modular approach keeps configurations isolated and easier to manage.
