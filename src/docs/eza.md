# Eza - Modern ls replacement

Eza is a modern, feature-rich replacement for the traditional Unix/Linux `ls` command.

## What it does

- Enhanced file listing with colors, git integration, and metadata
- Tree view for directory structures
- Human-readable dates and file sizes
- Extensive customization options

## Installation

Managed via chezmoi external sources (Linux) or package managers (macOS). See [eza installation guide](https://github.com/eza-community/eza/blob/main/INSTALL.md) for details.

## Shell Integration

### Aliases
Eza aliases over the built-in `ls` command:
- `ls`, `ll`, `la` - Basic and detailed listings
- `tree`, `lt` - Tree view

### Completions
Zsh tab completions are automatically downloaded and configured from the official eza completions archive, added to `FPATH` for shell integration.
