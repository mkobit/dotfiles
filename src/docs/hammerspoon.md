# Hammerspoon

Hammerspoon is a tool for powerful automation of macOS. At its core, Hammerspoon is just a bridge between the operating system and a Lua scripting engine. It allows you to write Lua scripts to interact with macOS APIs for applications, windows, mouse pointers, filesystems, audio devices, batteries, screens, low-level keyboard/mouse events, and more.

Official documentation can be found at [https://www.hammerspoon.org/docs/](https://www.hammerspoon.org/docs/).

## Configuration Directory

By default, Hammerspoon uses `~/.hammerspoon` for configuration. This dotfiles setup configures Hammerspoon to use the chezmoi-managed configuration directory at `.dotfiles/hammerspoon`.

The configuration location is set using the `MJConfigFile` preference, pointing to `{{ .chezmoi.destDir }}/.dotfiles/hammerspoon/init.lua` in templates.

**Important:** Spoons (Hammerspoon extensions) are computed relative to the config file location. Hammerspoon must be restarted after changing the configuration path.
