= Tmux Configuration
:toc: left
:toclevels: 3
:experimental:

== Overview

This document provides information about the tmux configuration used in this dotfiles repository.

== Key resources

* https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki[Official Tmux Wiki]
* https://man.openbsd.org/tmux[Tmux Manual Page]

== Configuration structure

The configuration is split into multiple files, all under the link:configs/[] directory.
Prefer colocating related configurations into specific instead of generalized configuration files.
For example, instead of `windows.tmux`, create `window.naming.tmux`, `window.notifications.tmux`, and others.

== Documenting settings

Prefer to add direct web links to every configuration option.
This allows for inspection of the settings, available options, and usage examples.
For example, `# https://man.openbsd.org/tmux#activity-action` comment directly preceding the configuration of the `activity-action` option.

== Key bindings

=== Defaults

The default key bindings are listed in the link:https://man.openbsd.org/tmux#DEFAULT_KEY_BINDINGS[`man` page].
They are also listed below for completeness

NOTE: In tmux key bindings, the following prefixes are used:

* kbd:[S-] represents Shift key
* kbd:[C-] or kbd:[^] represents Control key
For more details about key bindings, see the https://man.openbsd.org/tmux#KEY_BINDINGS[tmux manual].

=== Command style guidelines

When configuring tmux, it's recommended to use the full command names instead of aliases for better readability and maintainability:

|Preferred |Discouraged

|`set-window-option`
|`setw`

|`set-option`
|`set`

|`bind-key`
|`bind`

|`list-keys`
|`lsk`

|`send-keys`
|`send`

|`send-prefix`
