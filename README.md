# mkobit dotfiles and configurations
Contains dotfiles and other configurations that I prefer to use. This is topical based, and will be similar to [holman does dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles). I am doing this on my own rather than forking so I can actually get some more experience with shell configuration as well as Bash scripting.
