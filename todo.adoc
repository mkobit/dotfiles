== Active Ideas Backlog

* [ ] *Interactive fzf + jq Tool*
** Description: Create an interactive fuzzy search with preview while typing jq commands
** Requirements:
*** Interactive jq prompt with syntax coloration
*** Live preview of results as you type
** Implementation notes:
*** Use genrule + other rules to create a shell script or alias
*** Only build if tools are available (conditional dependency)
*** Consider zsh/bashrc integration requirements
** Reference: https://gist.github.com/reegnz/b9e40993d410b75c2d866441add2cb55[FZF+JQ Interactive Example]
** Evaluation status: Not started

* [ ] *Shell Script Additions*
** Description: To be expanded with specific ideas
** Requirements: TBD
** Implementation notes: TBD
** Evaluation status: Not started

* [ ] *"Installation" Rule for Config Files*
** Description: Add content to config files in an idempotent manner
** Requirements:
*** Insert section like include/source-file directive into specified files
*** Use surrounding boundary text (e.g., `###`, `---`) with unique labels
*** Ensure idempotent operation (write/include once)
** Implementation notes:
*** Potential use cases: tmux source-file directives, git [include] directives, general config inclusions
** Evaluation status: Not started

* [ ] *Memory System for AI Assistants*
** Description: Create a breadcrumb system for Goose and other AI agents to discover previous work and solutions
** Requirements:
*** Persistent storage for insights and successful solutions
*** Indexing and retrieval mechanism for AI agents to follow breadcrumbs
*** Documentation structure that's both human and AI readable
** Implementation notes:
*** Consider storing insights in specialized markdown or AsciiDoc format
*** May need to define a standard template for capturing context and solutions
*** Could leverage existing file structure with special annotations or metadata
** Evaluation status: Not started

* [ ] *FZF for Tmux History Search*
** Description: Implement fuzzy search for tmux command history and session navigation
** Requirements:
*** Integration with tmux key bindings
*** Fuzzy search through command history
*** Preview window for seeing command context
** Implementation notes:
*** Leverage fzf for the fuzzy finding interface
*** Need appropriate keybindings that don't conflict with existing ones
*** Consider optimizing for both recent command retrieval and specialized searches
** Evaluation status: Not started

* [ ] *Enhanced Shell History with FZF*
** Description: Implement a smarter shell history system with contextual awareness and fuzzy search
** Requirements:
*** FZF integration for shell history searching
*** Context-aware history filtering (directory, git repository, branch)
*** Frequency-based history ranking instead of just chronological order
*** Intelligent pruning of less useful commands
** Implementation notes:
*** Leverage fzf for the fuzzy finding interface
*** Consider custom shell functions to track and score command usage
*** May require a persistent database or scoring mechanism
*** Should work with both bash and zsh
** Evaluation status: Not started
