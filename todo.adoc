== Active Ideas

* [ ] *Interactive fzf + jq Tool*
** Interactive fuzzy search with live jq preview
** Use genrule to create shell script/alias with conditional dependency

* [x] *Enhanced Shell History with FZF*
** âœ… Official FZF shell integration (Ctrl+R history, Ctrl+T files, Alt+C dirs)
** âœ… Bash and Zsh support using `fzf --bash` and `fzf --zsh`
** âœ… Defensive checking with helpful installation messages
** âœ… Tab completion and fuzzy matching throughout shell
** [ ] Context-aware history filtering (directory, git repo, branch)
** [ ] Frequency-based ranking instead of chronological

* [ ] *Memory System for AI Assistants*
** Breadcrumb system for AI agents to discover previous solutions
** Persistent storage with indexing for context and solutions

== Completed

* [x] *Guarded Install Rule*
** âœ… Idempotent config file installation with boundary guards
** âœ… Supports vim, zsh, git, tmux configurations
** âœ… Absolute path generation using BUILD_WORKSPACE_DIRECTORY
** âœ… Clean separation: rule does templating, users control content
