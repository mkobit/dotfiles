Personal dotfiles managed with Bazel for cross-platform configuration management.

All tool configurations are organized under the `src/` directory for better project structure.

== Quick Start

[source,bash]
----
# Build for personal profile
bazel build //... --//config:profile=personal

# Run tests
bazel test //...

# Install configurations
bazel run //config:install_all
----

== Features

* *Cross-platform*: Supports Linux, macOS, and Windows
* *Profile-based*: Separate personal and work configurations
* *Bazel-managed*: Reproducible builds and dependency management
* *Comprehensive testing*: Quality checks and validation
* *Security-first*: Pinned dependencies and automated security updates

== Security

This repository follows security best practices for CI/CD pipelines:

* *üîí Pinned Dependencies*: All GitHub Actions pinned to specific commit SHAs
* *üîÑ Automated Updates*: Dependabot configured for security updates
* *üõ°Ô∏è Supply Chain Security*: Minimized attack surface through version pinning
* *üìã Security Documentation*: Detailed practices in link:docs/SECURITY.adoc[docs/SECURITY.adoc]

Key security implementations:

* Actions pinned to commit hashes (not floating tags)
* Specific runner versions (ubuntu-24.04, macos-15, windows-2022)
* Homebrew install script pinned to specific commit
* Weekly automated security updates via Dependabot

See link:docs/SECURITY.adoc[docs/SECURITY.adoc] for complete security practices and incident response procedures.
