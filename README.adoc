= Dotfiles

Personal dotfiles managed with Bazel for cross-platform configuration management.

== Quick start

[source,bash]
----
# Build personal profile
bazel build //... --//config:profile=personal

# Run tests
bazel test //...

# Install configurations  
bazel run //config:install_all
----

== Features

- Cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Profile-based (personal/work configurations)
- Bazel-managed reproducible builds
- Guarded installation (safe config injection)
- Security-first (pinned dependencies, automated updates)

== Hammerspoon Automation

This repository uses link:https://www.hammerspoon.org[Hammerspoon] for powerful macOS automation. We use it to manage window layouts, hotkeys, and other system-level customizations via Lua scripting.

For detailed information on the Hammerspoon modules and our specific configuration, see our internal documentation.

== Current Project Status

**ðŸš§ Active Development**: Integrating chezmoi as deployment engine while preserving Bazel validation and testing.

See link:.agents/scratch_zone/2025-09-04-chezmoi-integration-plan.md[Chezmoi Integration Project Plan] for current development status, phases, and progress tracking.

== Installation

Guarded installation safely injects configs without overwriting existing files:

[source,bash]
----
# Install git config to ~/.gitconfig
bazel run //src/git:install_config_home

# Install zsh config to ~/.zshrc  
bazel run //src/zsh:install_config_home
----

== Profiles

- **Personal**: Development-focused, extended aliases, personal git settings
- **Work**: Corporate-friendly, compliance settings, professional git config

== Commands

[source,bash]
----
# Build
bazel build //... --//config:profile=personal
bazel run //:format

# Test
bazel test //...

# Install
bazel run //config:install_all
----
