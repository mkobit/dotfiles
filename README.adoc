This repository contains a Bazel-based system for managing dotfiles across different platforms and usage scenarios.

== Repository Structure

* `modules/`: Contains .bzl files with reusable Starlark rules and macros for dotfiles management
* `platforms/`: Contains BUILD files defining Bazel platform targets for different OS (Windows, Ubuntu WSL, macOS)
* `variants/`: Contains BUILD files defining targets for different usage scenarios (work_laptop, personal_desktop, etc.)
* `tools/`: Contains subdirectories for specific tools (git, tmux, neovim, etc.) each with their own BUILD file and templates
* `bin/`: Contains helper scripts used by Starlark rules for complex operations
* `selectors/`: Contains selection logic for platform-specific configuration
