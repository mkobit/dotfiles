** Context-aware history filtering (directory, git repo, branch)
** Frequency-based ranking instead of chronological
** Works with both bash and zsh

* [ ] *Memory System for AI Assistants*
** Breadcrumb system for AI agents to discover previous solutions
** Persistent storage with indexing for context and solutions

== Completed

* [x] *Guarded Install Rule*
** âœ… Idempotent config file installation with boundary guards
** âœ… Supports vim, zsh, git, tmux configurations
** âœ… Absolute path generation using BUILD_WORKSPACE_DIRECTORY
