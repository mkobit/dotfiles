= Dotfiles Project Ideas

== Active Ideas

* [x] *Interactive fzf + jq Tool*
** âœ… Simple interactive jq filtering with live preview (`ijq` command)
** âœ… Real-time filtering as you type (like https://github.com/ynqa/jnv[jnv] but quick & dirty)
** âœ… Handles both file input and stdin with proper error handling
** âœ… Tmux-optimized preview windows (auto-detects environment)
** âœ… Integrated with existing FZF configuration and styling
** âœ… Defensive programming with dependency checks and helpful error messages
** Reference: https://gist.github.com/reegnz/b9e40993d410b75c2d866441add2cb55[FZF+JQ Interactive Example]

* [ ] *FZF for Tmux History Search*
** Fuzzy search for tmux command history and session navigation
** Integration with tmux key bindings and preview windows

* [ ] *Holistic Zsh Keybinding Strategy*
** âœ… Phase 1 Complete: Systematic conflict analysis and vi mode fix
** Cross-platform keybinding design for macOS â†’ iTerm2 â†’ tmux â†’ zsh â†’ vim workflow
** 5-layer conflict analysis: System â†’ Terminal â†’ Tmux â†’ Shell â†’ Editor
** Established safe foundation: FZF bindings (Ctrl-R/T, Alt-C) + vi mode
** Fixed oh-my-zsh loading order issue (vi mode was being overridden)
** Created comprehensive audit documentation in KEYBINDING_AUDIT.md
** [ ] Phase 2: Establish core safe keybindings (Ctrl-P/N, Ctrl-A/E, Ctrl-W)
** [ ] Phase 3: Enhanced vim-style navigation (word/line movement)
** [ ] Environment-specific testing (iTerm2, Terminal.app, WSL, VS Code)
** [ ] Tmux integration considerations (prefix conflicts, copy mode)
** [ ] Context-aware bindings (different behavior in/out of tmux)
** Design principles: consistency, non-interference, discoverability, escape hatches
** Tiered implementation: essential â†’ enhanced â†’ advanced features

* [x] *Enhanced Shell History with FZF*
** âœ… Official FZF shell integration (Ctrl+R history, Ctrl+T files, Alt+C dirs)
** âœ… Bash and Zsh support using `fzf --bash` and `fzf --zsh`
** âœ… Defensive checking with helpful installation messages
** âœ… Tab completion and fuzzy matching throughout shell
** âœ… Smart directory skipping (.git, node_modules, target, bazel-*)
** âœ… Intelligent preview (bat/cat for files, tree/ls for directories)
** âœ… Circular navigation and enhanced key bindings
** [ ] Context-aware history filtering (directory, git repo, branch)
** [ ] Frequency-based ranking instead of chronological

* [ ] *Memory System for AI Assistants*
** Breadcrumb system for AI agents to discover previous solutions
** Persistent storage with indexing for context and solutions

== Completed

* [x] *Chezmoi Migration*
** âœ… Replaced Bazel guarded_install with chezmoi modify scripts
** âœ… Individual config snippets instead of file concatenation  
** âœ… Corporate file handling with SHA256 tracking

* [x] *Guarded Install Rule* (OBSOLETE)
** âœ… Bazel-based config installation (replaced by chezmoi)

== Current Architecture

=== Chezmoi
* Config snippets in `src/dot_dotfiles/`
* Modify scripts for corporate files
* Profile templating (personal/work)

=== Bazel (automation/)
* Validation and testing
* Linting and formatting
* Schema validation

=== ðŸ”„ Potential Enhancements
* Ripgrep, fd, fzf, bat integration
* Docker/Kubernetes tools configuration
* SSH config management
* iTerm2/terminal emulator settings
* Rectangle (macOS) window management
