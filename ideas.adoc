= Dotfiles Project Ideas

== Active Ideas

* [ ] *FZF for Tmux History Search*
** Fuzzy search for tmux command history and session navigation
** Integration with tmux key bindings and preview windows

* [ ] *Shell Keybinding Improvements*
** Cross-platform keybinding design for macOS → iTerm2 → tmux → zsh → vim workflow
** Safe foundation: FZF bindings (Ctrl-R/T, Alt-C) + vi mode already established
** Consider core navigation bindings and tmux integration conflicts

* [ ] *AI Assistant Context System*
** Use existing root agent directories (`.claude`, `.cursor`, `.jules`) for session persistence
** Context breadcrumbs for discovering previous solutions

== Architecture

* Config snippets in `src/dot_dotfiles/`
* Modify scripts for corporate files  
* Profile templating (personal/work)

== Future Considerations

* Enhanced tool integrations (ripgrep, fd, bat)
* Container tools configuration
* SSH and terminal emulator settings
* Window management integration
