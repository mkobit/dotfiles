        Describe how the tool should be configured. Consider the following:
        *   Are there configuration files? Where should they live? (e.g., `~/.config/tool/config.toml`)
        *   Does it require shell integration (e.g., adding something to `.zshrc`)?
        *   Are there keybindings to set up?
        *   Does it use environment variables for configuration?
        *   Does it integrate with other tools (e.g., Vim, tmux)?
      placeholder: |
        - The main config file is ~/.config/fzf/fzf.toml
        - Keybindings for CTRL-T and CTRL-R should be enabled in Zsh.
        - Set the FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND environment variable to use 'fd'.
